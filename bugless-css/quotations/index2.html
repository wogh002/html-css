        <p>The study is the first to project the long-term outlook for Antarctica's largest penguins, which can grow 1.2
            meters (four ft) tall, seeking to fill a gap in understanding climate change and wildlife in one of the
            remotest
            parts of the planet.</p>

        <p>Overall, numbers were set to fall by at least 19 percent from current levels by 2100 as sea ice melts. And
            two-thirds of colonies of the birds, which have distinctive golden head patches, would decline by more than
            half, it said.</p>

            <q>It's not happy news for the emperor penguin,</q>said Hal Castellan of the U.S. Woods Hole Oceanographic
            Institution,
            a co-author of the study in the journal Nature Climate Change.
